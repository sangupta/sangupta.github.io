I recently had the chance of attending my first 
<a href="http://www.adobesummit.com/">Adobe Flash Platform Summit</a>. The whole experience 
was just awesome, and this I say not because I am currently with 
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, but for the wealth of information, tips and tricks, 
demos and tutorials, the evangelist team shared. The sessions had packed a lot of information, 
which to grasp in the given time frame was difficult. Add to it the magical Bangalore weather 
and the tasty south indian dishes for lunch, my experience enhances many a folds.

Anyways, this post is not about the shared information (there will be more later), but about 
the best time and/or session, we had in the summit. To disappoint all the geeks, what am I 
talking of is the live performance of the contemporary carnatic rock band, 
<a href="http://www.agamtheband.in/">Agam</a>. What made it more enjoyable was the fact that 
all group members are engineers of the IT industry (gosh, where do they find time from) from 
companies like `Adobe`, `Yahoo!` and more.

More on Agam in their own words,
