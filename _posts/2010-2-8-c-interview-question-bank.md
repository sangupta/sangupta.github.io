    For some reason I happened to be searching for a good question bank on C++ questions that may aid one in brushing up concepts just before the call of an interview. My search did lead to some very useful stuff (though a bit stale and old) which I happen to share in now.
    <br>
    <br>The following questions are part of this bank. All credit goes to 
    <b>Marshall Cline</b> from 
    <i>Paradigm Shift, Inc</i>. Somehow the contact information mentioned in the document doesn't work, but when do the concepts change, right?
