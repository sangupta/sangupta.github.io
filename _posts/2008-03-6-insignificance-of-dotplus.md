I had been using GMail for over two and half years now. But, still there are many 
tricks that you need to learn. It was one such day today, when I came to know the 
power (or insignificance) of a DOT in the GMail email address. May be I will take 
an example to start with. My email address happens to be `sandy.pec@gmail.com`. Preventing 
spammers gain access to email address is so tough ;)

<!-- break here -->

Now guess what would happen if some one was to send an email to
`sandypec@gmail.com`. Logically and with any other email service, the email would be 
sent to some one with that address and not to me. Right! WRONG! This is where GMail 
makes a difference. GMail does not recognizes DOT in email addresses before the AT `@` symbol. 
This mean that email addresses like 
`sandypec, sandy.pec, san.dy.pec, s.a.n.d.y.p.e.c` are all one and the same. Yes, they are! 
So an email sent to an address, which after stripping all DOTS, leads to 'sandypec' as 
the address part, would always be delivered to me.

May of you would think of it as a bug or a limitation of GMail, where-in it is not able 
to assign addresses to people. NO! It is an advantage, a boon for users like you and me. 
Now I can configure multiple email addresses all in one email box. So, say I have one 
primary address as `sandy.pec`, I can use `sandypec` while registering for some online 
community and then redirect all emails coming to `sandypec` as the address into a folder, 
aka tags using filters (and of course, auto archive). Similarly you can register `san.dy.pec`
as another email address for those register-only forums, and redirect all emails to trash :)

Well, this seems a bit difficult to use dots to achieve this functionality. How can one 
remember what email address has he/she configured or not? There is a solution to this 
too. GMail has another bug or to say feature, where-in it strips down all characters 
after a PLUS `+` symbol in an email address. So an address like 
`sandypec+online` is stripped down to `sandypec` and delivered to my mail box `sandy.pec`. 
Isn't this cool. So now I can have email addresses like 

* `sandypec+mobilebill` for registering email bills
* `sandypec+banking` for bank registeration
* `sandypec+trash` for emails whose destination should be trash
* `sandypec+forums` for all technical forums and groups.

This should help an average user keep his mails sorted and box clean. Wow! A nice thought-of 
feature from Google.

`TIP:` Configure all emails to go into trash box if there is no DOT in the email address. 
Reason - Well, spammers would also read this, and know that in case of GMail addresses, they 
can strip down DOTS and PLUS to make their email reach inbox. In case of `sandypec` they will 
never ever know where to place the DOT or a PLUS to make it to inbox. For it's you and me 
who know that I am `sandy.pec`

Hope this helps.
