Problem
-------

Given a character stream as an array, encode the characters in place replacing given set of 
characters by their 3-character equivalent. The array is terminated by a `0x00` character. 
If the array cannot be fully encoded, the array should not be modified.

Solution
--------

This is a classic interview problem. There are two aspects to this problem,

* Calculating whether the array would be able to contain the entirely encoded string. This 
can be easily achieved by calculating the length of the string, the number of encod<i>able</i> 
characters and the size of the array. If the free space in the array is equal to the additional 
capacity that would be needed by the encod<i>able</i> characters </li>

* Encode the string from tail than from head. This is a must so that one does not override the 
characters ahead, when an encod<i>able</i> character is written encoded in the string.

A simple JAVA implementation is shown below:

```java
/**
 * Class to encode a given character stream (defined as char[] array). The character array is the only
 * memory space one has. In case encoding is not possible, the array should be left untouched. The array
 * will be terminated by a <code>null</code> to indicate string termination.
 * 
 * Each encodable character is 3 characters in length. Thus, additional space required would be 2 characters
 * per each encodable character.
