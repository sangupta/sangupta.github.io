Many a times while searching for information on Internet we come across webpages that 
are actually in any other language. Worse still, sometimes they are the only pages that 
have some information (only single digit results in Google). This is common for people 
whose native language is not English.

While there are tools like 
<a href="http://www.google.com/language_tools">Google Translate</a> to convert a given webpage 
into a desired language, they can help only if we know the source language of the content 
for sure. At times it gets difficult.

The same happened with me while strolling for information related to Highway engineering. There 
was this one tutorial about the concept, and the only second link. My query fetched me only 2 
results in Google. Ah, my bad luck.

I tried Google for every combination of language provided but couldn't retrieve any information. 
My curiosity took me to search for a language identification tool. My results in Google 
fetched me some 22 million results, but most of them were either demo or could not identify 
the language of the tutorial. I dug deeper into the results.

Then I found 
<a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/translate/identify.php">FaganFinder</a>, it identified the 
page in a few seconds. The power of the tool was quite compelling, and I was forced to try the 
tool more. I searched for more and more pages (the language of which I could not identify) and 
then I found this page which even FaganFinder wasn't able to decipher. Now what, my search for 
the ultimate language identification tool continued until I came across 
<a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/tools/guesser-ISO-8859-1.en.html">Xerox 
PARC website</a> for translation. Now this one could decipher the page immediately for me.

* <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/translate/identify.php">FaganFinder</a>
* <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/tools/guesser-ISO-8859-1.en.html">Xerox PARC</a>

are the two tools that can come handy for language identification of a webpage.
