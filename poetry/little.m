A Little
--------

A little of heart, a little of brain

in little of sun, n in little of rain

painting in zillion colors, thoughts so arcane

alive you bring, the canvas mundane

new heights with every step, you attain

all would agree, with me in fain

meaningful thoughts, your paradise contains

impression of which, in our minds always remain!
