A Promise
---------

Apologies to a friend
whom I have offended
but believe me bud
it was never my intent

its not your hard work
that I try to question
not the way you live
that I try to reason

I didn't mean to be
unkind or rude
it was only an attempt
to create a prelude

a failed attempt to hide
the feelings deep inside
of what can't be described
in words, but only by eyes

Give me one more chance
and never will I say again
words that may annoy
or have shades of nuance

Today I make a promise
A promise I promise 
not to break, not to
repeat the same mistake again!
